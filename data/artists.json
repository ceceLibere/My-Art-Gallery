    "biography": "ZANETA GELEVSKA VELJANOSKA-ZANI graduated from the Faculty of Fine Art Skopje, Macedonia in 1989. She participated in numerous exhibitions in her native Macedonia, involving herself in various art related projects. Her work has reached over 15 countries worldwide and is in many private and public collections. In 1999 Zani was invited to exhibit at the prestigious Blains Fine Art Gallery in Mayfair, London and soon after that she relocated to England, where she is now operating as a full time freelance artist. Zani is always experimenting and her paintings are a unique blend achieved by combining acrylic and mixed media and a range of unusual materials. These materials have become a distinguishing feature of Zani\u2019s work and in many cases the materials dictate the form, as well as give the paintings their distinctive quality. Zani\u2019s paintings have a powerful strength and refreshing spontaneity with rich variations of colour and tone. Most of her inspiration is drawn from ordinary people and everyday experiences and events. The work is often based on the relationship between public and private space, memories of the past and visions of the future. Zani is fast becoming a sought after talent in the world of contemporary art and exhibits her work during the year in a number of galleries in London and throughout the UK. However, a permanent exhibition of her work is on display, and can be viewed, in the Macedonian Embassy in London."

    "biography": "Born in 1944 in Otosnica, Republic of Macedonia. Next to Stojan Pacov, he is one of the most famous Macedonian painters who live and work in Belgrade, Serbia. He finished Pedagogical Academy in Skopje. The most influence on his art came from the work of ,fellow Macedonian painter, Lazar Li\u010denovski, and the French painter Auguste Renoir. The most of his paintings are associated with landscape of his homeplace Otosnice, near Kriva Palanka. He recreates the colors of dried, sometimes, scorched grass, ripe wheat, and trees that stand the prolonged drought. Besides landscapes, which are his favorite motif, his work contains images of urban exteriors, images inspired by the rich history and images in which he is trying to decipher the position of a man in the cosmos."

    "biography": "Gordana Vincic was born in Skopje, Macedonia, and lives and works in Malmo, Sweden. In 1998 she completed her studies in Social Work and Politics at the renowned Lund University. After graduation, she starts to deal with psychology, and also acquires 15 years of leadership experience in several areas. A great influence on Gordana's work has her mother, who, as a painter and art historian, has been planting the roots and secrets of painting from small footsteps. The father of Vincic's free-domed painting also has her father who is the bearer of the Medal of Courage, Order of Labor and Jubilee Medal for the Protection of the Monuments of Culture in the then SFRY.Gordana's works themselves are narrative and carry deep mysticism, nostalgia and surreal symbolism. Every piece of art stimulates the senses, draws thoughts and demands for answers. The author combines art and personal development through his works, and the main stimulus is the fascination of the subconscious knowledge and wisdom that every person carries within himself. The observer wants to cause thoughts about the mysticism of life, mythology and symbolism, in order to achieve a higher level of awareness and happiness."

    "biography": "VANGEL NAUMOVSKI was born in 1924 in the Macedonian city of Ohrid (then part of Yugoslavia). He was interested in art at a young age, but this led nowhere as he left school after third grade and worked a series of odd jobs - gardener, farmer, butcher. After a stint in the army, he enrolled in art school in Skopje in 1946, lasting a year. He then worked in a woodcarving shop in Ohrid for thirteen years. During this time he was painting, initially in a folk myth style which led to him being considered a Naive artist. In the early 60s his painting morphed into a gooey sort of surrealism. He first exhibited in Yugoslavia in the 50s, and later had one-man shows in Rome, London, Paris, and Toronto. At some point he started a gallery in his home in Ohrid (it is unknown whether it is still open). He died in 2006."

    "biography": "PETAR MAZEV - Born in 1927 in Kavadarci, he died in 1993 in Skopje, a Macedonian painter, one of the most notable creators of Macedonian modern art. He graduated from the Academy of Fine Arts in 1953 in Belgrade in the class of prof. Zora Petrovic. The same year he became a member of DLUM and begins with exhibitions of group and solo exhibitions. He studied in several European countries.In 1959 he became professor at the Faculty of Architecture in Skopje, and in 1980 he was elected professor at the Faculty of Fine Arts in Skopje, where he remained until retirement. He has received numerous awards, including: 'Sapiro' in Paris (1959), 'October 11' (1961),'November 13' (1965), 'Nikola Martinovski' for drawing (1981), SLUJ painting painting award ), award for painting of DLUM (1987) and others.He graduated from the Academy of Fine Arts in Belgrade in 1953. He was a member of the group 'Mugri'. Professor at the Faculty of Architecture, Skopje. Petar Mazev is one of the main initiators of the establishment of the Faculty of Fine Arts in Skopje. An expressionist, he went through several stages in his work (of which the 'white' phase is particularly significant) under the influence of Willem de Kunig's abstract expressionism and the KoBrA group to create an abstract-figurative expression of gestural action and strong coloring. Together with Nicholas Martinoski, he is the most eminent representative of expressionism. For Petar Mazev, Macedonia is a substrate of strong emotional experiences. In his artistic system, the plastic tradition of the nation breaks into a transitive sense. Mazev more excites the unusually harsh, contrasting drama of the geographical structure of the country, the breath of the past and the patina that is embedded in her matter, in the old buildings and objects. He has a close feeling about the effects of matter characteristic of some works by Antoni Tapies and Alberto Burry. However, the current abstract naturalism of Mazev contains an aspiration for refraining from propagating expressiveness, matching material into strict systems, within almost monochrome images. The last stage in the work of Mazev comes out of the already already very associative matter of his works and moves towards unusual plastic agglomerations. He exhibited in Skopje and at numerous group exhibitions in the country and abroad: Burma, China, India, France, Chile, Milan, Belgrade, exhibitions in Dijon, Bratford, Rome, Turin, Nuremberg, Stuttgart, Berlin, Nim, Schell , Paris, Beijing, Lausanne, Mexico City, Athens, etc. He made and muruled at the Skopje Ironworks in 1967, mosaics in Stopanska Banka and the State Hospital in 1971, all in Skopje and the Memorial Oasis in Veles, 1979; ceramoplasty at the monument of Ilinden, Krushevo, 1974. Winner of the October Award for Painting 1960, November Award of the City of Skopje 1977 and others."

    "biography": "PABLO PICASSO - (1881-1973) Spanish expatriate Pablo Picasso was one of the greatest and most influential artists of the 20th century, as well as the co-creator of Cubism.Pablo Picasso (October 25, 1881 to April 8, 1973) was a Spanish expatriate painter, sculptor, printmaker, ceramicist and stage designer considered one of the greatest and most influential artists of the 20th century and the co-creator, along with Georges Braque, of Cubism. Considered radical in his work, Picasso continues to garner reverence for his technical mastery, visionary creativity and profound empathy. Together, these qualities have distinguished the 'disquieting' Spaniard with the 'sombrepiercing' eyes as a revolutionary artist. For nearly 80 of his 91 years, Picasso devoted himself to an artistic production that he superstitiously believed would keep him alive, contributing significantly to \u2014 and paralleling the entire development of \u2014 modern art in the 20th century."

From an early age Dal\u00ed was encouraged to practice his art, and he would eventually go on to study at an academy in Madrid. In the 1920s, he went to Paris and began interacting with artists such as Picasso, Magritte and Mir\u00f3, which led to Dal\u00ed's first Surrealist phase. He is perhaps best known for his 1931 painting The Persistence of Memory, showing melting clocks in a landscape setting. The rise of fascist leader Francisco Franco in Spain led to the artist's expulsion from the Surrealist movement, but that didn't stop him from painting. Dal\u00ed died in Figueres in 1989."

He enrolled in the Academie Suisse. After an art exhibition in 1874, a critic insultingly dubbed Monet's painting style 'Impression', since it was more concerned with form and light than realism, and the term stuck. Monet struggled with depression, poverty and illness throughout his life. He died in 1926."

He was orphaned at age 11 and apprenticed with a painter in Milan. He moved to Rome, where his work became popular for the tenebrism technique he used, which used shadow to emphasize lighter areas. His career, however, was short-lived. Caravaggio killed a man during a brawl and fled Rome. He died not long after, on July 18, 1610."

The mastery of design, tone, composition and color that spans his life's work is highly characteristic and now recognizable around the world. Both Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso were greatly influenced by C\u00e9zanne."

The young boy originally wanted to become a priest. Then he decided to study philosophy. But both ideas were abandoned and in 1900 he took painting classes at the Munich Academy of Fine Arts.Paris was at that time the center of the arts. Impressionism had revolutionized the traditional art world. Traveling to Paris and studying the modern painters like Claude Monet, van Gogh, or Paul Gauguin was a must for a progressive young artist. Marc Franz undertook several travels to Paris - the first in 1903 and again in 1907 and in 1912. He was deeply influenced by the modern French painters."

  "biography": "Georg Baselitz (born 23 January 1938, as Hans-Georg Kern, in Deutschbaselitz, Germany) is a German painter, sculptor and graphic artist. In the 1960s he became well known for his figurative, expressive paintings. Since 1969, he paints his subjects upside down in an effort to overcome the representational, content-driven character of his earlier work and stress the artifice of painting. Drawing from a myriad of influences, including art of Soviet era illustration art, the Mannerist period and African sculptures, he developed his own, distinct artistic language.Since Baselitz grew up amongst the suffering and demolition of World War II, the concept of destruction plays a significant role in his life and work. These autobiographical circumstances have therefore returned throughout his whole oeuvre. In this context, the artist stated in an interview: 'I was born into a destroyed order, a destroyed landscape, a destroyed people, a destroyed society. And I didn't want to reestablish an order: I had seen enough of so-called order. I was forced to question everything, to be 'naive', to start again'. By disrupting any given orders and breaking the common conventions of perception, Baselitz has formed his personal circumstances into his guiding artistic principles. To this day, he still inverts all his paintings, which has become his unique and most defining feature in his work."

  "biography": "Jacob Lawrence (September 7, 1917 – June 9, 2000) was an African-American painter known for his portrayal of African-American life. As well as a painter, storyteller, and interpreter, he was an educator. Lawrence referred to his style as 'dynamic cubism', though by his own account the primary influence was not so much French art as the shapes and colors of Harlem. He brought the African-American experience to life using blacks and browns juxtaposed with vivid colors. He also taught and spent 15 years as a professor at the University of Washington.Lawrence is among the best-known 20th-century African-American painters. He was 25 years old when he gained national recognition with his 60-panel Migration Series, painted on cardboard. The series depicted the Great Migration of African-Americans from the rural South to the urban North. A part of this series was featured in a 1941 issue of Fortune. The collection is now held by two museums: the odd-numbered paintings are on exhibit in the Phillips Collection in Washington, D.C., and the even-numbered are on display at MOMA in New York. Lawrence's works are in the permanent collections of numerous museums, including the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum, the Phillips Collection, Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Brooklyn Museum, and Reynolda House Museum of American Art. He is widely known for his modernist illustrations of everyday life as well as epic narratives of African American history and historical figures."

During the 1980s Tuset moved to Canada, where he lived for six years and exhibited at Edimage gallery, Joyce Yahouda Gallery and the Cultart Gallery. He also exhibited at the Art Institute of Chicago, and at 87 FIAC International Art Fair au Grand Palais of Paris. In 1989, he moved to Paris, where he settled for six months and exhibited at Vison Quai Gallery. These stages were a fundamental change in his life and work, as his figurative compositions gained more force and tension, and the characters of his works acquired a more classic basis, and his style was enriched with personal and expressive deformations. When he returned to Catalonia, he settled between L'Arboç, his hometown, and the city of Barcelona."

Suh is best known for his fabric sculptures that reconstruct to scale his former homes in Korea, Rhode Island, Berlin, London, and New York. Suh is interested in the malleability of space in both its physical and metaphorical forms, and examines how the body relates to, inhabits, and interacts with that space. He is particularly interested in domestic space and the way the concept of home can be articulated through architecture that has a specific location, form, and history. For Suh, the spaces we inhabit also contain psychological energy, and in his work he makes visible those markers of memories, personal experiences, and a sense of security, regardless of geographic location."

Inspired by the country's popular culture, she employed a naïve folk art style to explore questions of identity, postcolonialism, gender, class, and race in Mexican society. Her paintings often had strong autobiographical elements and mixed realism with fantasy. In addition to belonging to the post-revolutionary Mexicayotl movement, which sought to define a Mexican identity, Kahlo has been described as a surrealist or magical realist.Kahlo's work has been celebrated internationally as emblematic of Mexican national and Indigenous traditions, and by feminists for what is seen as its uncompromising depiction of the female experience and form."

By the 1980s, he was exhibiting his neo-expressionist paintings in galleries and museums internationally. The Whitney Museum of American Art held a retrospective of his art in 1992.Basquiat's art focused on 'suggestive dichotomies', such as wealth versus poverty, integration versus segregation, and inner versus outer experience. He appropriated poetry, drawing, and painting, and married text and image, abstraction, figuration, and historical information mixed with contemporary critique."

In the 1780s his cerebral brand of history painting marked a change in taste away from Rococo frivolity toward classical austerity and severity and heightened feeling, harmonizing with the moral climate of the final years of the Ancien Régime. David later became an active supporter of the French Revolution and friend of Maximilien Robespierre (1758–1794), and was effectively a dictator of the arts under the French Republic. Imprisoned after Robespierre's fall from power, he aligned himself with yet another political regime upon his release: that of Napoleon, The First Consul of France. At this time he developed his Empire style, notable for its use of warm Venetian colours. After Napoleon's fall from Imperial power and the Bourbon revival, David exiled himself to Brussels, then in the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, where he remained until his death. David had a large number of pupils, making him the strongest influence in French art of the early 19th century, especially academic Salon painting."

Haring's work grew to popularity from his spontaneous drawings in New York City subways – chalk outlines on blank black advertising-space backgrounds – depicting radiant babies, flying saucers, and deified dogs. After public recognition he created larger scale works such as colorful murals, many of them commissioned. His imagery has 'become a widely recognized visual language'. His later work often addressed political and societal themes – especially homosexuality and AIDS – through his own iconography."

An innovative and prolific master in three media, he is generally considered one of the greatest visual artists in the history of art and the most important in Dutch art history. Unlike most Dutch masters of the 17th century, Rembrandt's works depict a wide range of style and subject matter, from portraits and self-portraits to landscapes, genre scenes, allegorical and historical scenes, biblical and mythological themes as well as animal studies. His contributions to art came in a period of great wealth and cultural achievement that historians call the Dutch Golden Age, when Dutch art (especially Dutch painting), although in many ways antithetical to the Baroque style that dominated Europe, was extremely prolific and innovative, and gave rise to important new genres. Like many artists of the Dutch Golden Age, such as Jan Vermeer of Delft, Rembrandt was also known as an avid art collector and dealer."

  "biography": "Jean Désiré Gustave Courbet (10 June 1819 – 31 December 1877) was a French painter who led the Realism movement in 19th-century French painting. Committed to painting only what he could see, he rejected academic convention and the Romanticism of the previous generation of visual artists. His independence set an example that was important to later artists, such as the Impressionists and the Cubists. Courbet occupies an important place in 19th-century French painting as an innovator and as an artist willing to make bold social statements through his work. Courbet's paintings of the late 1840s and early 1850s brought him his first recognition. They challenged convention by depicting unidealized peasants and workers, often on a grand scale traditionally reserved for paintings of religious or historical subjects. Courbet's subsequent paintings were mostly of a less overtly political character: landscapes, seascapes, hunting scenes, nudes and still lifes. An active socialist, Courbet was active in the political developments of France. He was imprisoned for six months in 1871 for his involvement with the Paris Commune, and lived in exile in Switzerland from 1873 until his death."

He grew up in the eighties and naturally was inspired by the American life; music, skating and so forth. The love for music, more in particular hip-hop, quickly joined his curiosity in graffiti. Like most muralists, he began by spraying throw-ups under bridges and walls. During his early years, Roa expressed an active, eclectic mix of styles. At the time, there was not prevailing movement in Belgium. As time went on, the scene’s evolution further evolved as foreign visitors left behind an assorted collection of talents and skills. Slowly but sure Roa became addicted to the nature of urban art.Roa is primarily known for his strong obsession for animals and rodents. He often combines life, death, and life after death in his murals, which quickly distinguishes him amongst traditional muralists. His animals are painted to include skeleton and internal organs, making the sight even more realistic."

  "biography": "John Pugh (born 1957) is an American artist known for creating large trompe-l'oeil wall murals giving the illusion of a three-dimensional scene behind the wall. Pugh has been creating his murals since the late 1970s. He attended California State University Chico, receiving his BA in 1983 and the Distinguished Alumni Award in 2003. He has received over 250 public and private commissions in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Barbados, Japan, Taiwan, and New Zealand. He currently lives and works in Truckee, California. His particular style of trompe-l'oeil painting has been called 'Narrative Illusionism'.His works have been described as 'not merely ornamental or curiously clever. They are thought-provoking, substantial, and sometimes even philosophical or spiritual. What separates the murals of John Pugh from their less consequential cousins is that he goes beyond trompe l’oeil by combining techniques of illusion with narrative or conceptual elements and thereby not only 'fools the eye' but captures the imagination and engages the mind as well'."

  "biography": "Ferdinand Victor Eugène Delacroix (26 April 1798 – 13 August 1863) was a French Romantic artist regarded from the outset of his career as the leader of the French Romantic school. As a painter and muralist, Delacroix's use of expressive brushstrokes and his study of the optical effects of colour profoundly shaped the work of the Impressionists, while his passion for the exotic inspired the artists of the Symbolist movement. A fine lithographer, Delacroix illustrated various works of William Shakespeare, the Scottish author Walter Scott and the German author Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. In contrast to the Neoclassical perfectionism of his chief rival Ingres, Delacroix took for his inspiration the art of Rubens and painters of the Venetian Renaissance, with an attendant emphasis on colour and movement rather than clarity of outline and carefully modelled form. Dramatic and romantic content characterized the central themes of his maturity, and led him not to the classical models of Greek and Roman art, but to travel in North Africa, in search of the exotic. Friend and spiritual heir to Théodore Géricault, Delacroix was also inspired by Lord Byron, with whom he shared a strong identification with the 'forces of the sublime', of nature in often violent action. However, Delacroix was given to neither sentimentality nor bombast, and his Romanticism was that of an individualist. In the words of Baudelaire, 'Delacroix was passionately in love with passion, but coldly determined to express passion as clearly as possible'."

  "biography": "Jean Désiré Gustave Courbet (10 June 1819 – 31 December 1877) was a French painter who led the Realism movement in 19th-century French painting. Committed to painting only what he could see, he rejected academic convention and the Romanticism of the previous generation of visual artists. His independence set an example that was important to later artists, such as the Impressionists and the Cubists. Courbet occupies an important place in 19th-century French painting as an innovator and as an artist willing to make bold social statements through his work. Courbet's paintings of the late 1840s and early 1850s brought him his first recognition. They challenged convention by depicting unidealized peasants and workers, often on a grand scale traditionally reserved for paintings of religious or historical subjects. Courbet's subsequent paintings were mostly of a less overtly political character: landscapes, seascapes, hunting scenes, nudes and still lifes. An active socialist, Courbet was active in the political developments of France. He was imprisoned for six months in 1871 for his involvement with the Paris Commune, and lived in exile in Switzerland from 1873 until his death."

  "biography": "John Constable, RA (11 June 1776 – 31 March 1837) was an English landscape painter in the naturalistic tradition. Born in Suffolk, he is known principally for his landscape paintings of Dedham Vale, the area surrounding his home — now known as 'Constable Country' — which he invested with an intensity of affection. 'I should paint my own places best', he wrote to his friend John Fisher in 1821, 'painting is but another word for feeling'. His most famous paintings include Wivenhoe Park of 1816, Dedham Vale of 1802 and The Hay Wain of 1821. Although his paintings are now among the most popular and valuable in British art, Constable was never financially successful. He did not become a member of the establishment until he was elected to the Royal Academy at the age of 52. His work was embraced in France, where he sold more works than in his native England and inspired the Barbizon school."
